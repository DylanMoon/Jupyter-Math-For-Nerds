## In this folder there are examples of HTML files imaged from Jupyter Notebook files [.ipynb extension]
### To view each image there is a simple and short method.  
#### Go to the Jupyter-Math-for-Nerds Folder and click on the DOWNLAD zip button [Upper Right Hand Side of the Page]
 -  A zipped folder will go to your Downloads folder [for most systems].  
  - Unzip it, go to the HTML folder and open it with your Browser.
  
#### GitHub will now allow you to download a single file [yet].
 - There are a couple of workarounds I found by googling, but they were too complicated or quirky.
 
  #### Let me know if you have problems.  I want to make this work
