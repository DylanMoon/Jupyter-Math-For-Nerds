## In this folder there are examples of Jupyter Notebook files [.ipynb extension]
### There are three simple and short methods to view each of the Notebook files.
 - Download the Anaconda Framework from https://www.anaconda.com/download/
 - Just select the Framework for your computer Windows/Mac OS/Linix and either 32 or 64 bit installer
 - You should downlad the 3.x version.  Version 2.7 will no longer be supported soon.
 - Understand that the download is larger than 500 MD, so get a cop of coffee [I hope you have speedy WiFi !]
 - You will get an .exe type file.  Just double click on it and take the defaults [for most users]
 - If you do this for Windows 10 for PC, start Jupyter from the command line by pressing the 'PLAG' key and R, type in Jupyter.
  - You can change each of the cells in the Notebook for your particular math problem.
 ### The easiest way is just to to the Jupyter-Math-for-Nerds Folder and click on the DOWNLAD zip button [Upper Right Hand Side of the Page]
  - A zipped folder will go to your Downloads folder [for most systems].  
  - Unzip it, go to the Notebook folder and open it with your Browser.
  
 ### Another option is to install a Notebook Viewer Add-on for your Browser.
  - Just double click on any .ipynb file.  Note that you can not make changes to this file.
  
#### Let me know if you have problems.  I want to make this work.
#### GitHub will now allow you to download a single file [yet].
