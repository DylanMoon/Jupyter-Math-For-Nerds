## In this folder there are examples of Jupyter Notebook files [.ipynb extension]
#### GitHub does not allow downloading individual files easily.

### There are three simple and short methods to view each of the Notebook files.

### The easist way to just look at a Notebook file is load an Add-On or Extension to Google Chrome
 - Open your Chrome app and go to https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/nbviewer
   - Click on the blue button "+ ADD TO CHROME" for the 'Open in nbviewer' extension
   - Then just click on any of the .ipynb files
   - You will see the entire Notebook but you can not make changes

### Another option is to install a Notebook Viewer Add-on for your Browser.
 - Download the Anaconda Framework from https://www.anaconda.com/download/
 - Select the Framework for your computer Windows/Mac OS/Linix and either the 32 or 64 bit installer.
 - You should downlad the 3.x version.  Version 2.7 will no longer be supported soon.
 - Understand that the download is larger than 500 MD, so get a cop of coffee [I hope you have speedy WiFi !]
 - You will get an .exe type file.  Just double click on it and take the defaults [for most users]
 - If you do this for Windows 10 for PC, start Jupyter from the command line by pressing the 'PLAG' key and R, type in Jupyter.
  - You can change each of the cells or add new cells in the Notebook for your particular math problem.
  
 ### Finally go to te Jupyter-Math-for-Nerds Folder and click on the DOWNLAD zip button [Upper Right Hand Side of the Page]
  - A zipped folder will go to your Downloads folder [for most systems].  
  - Unzip it, go to the Notebook folder and open it with your Browser.
  
#### Let me know if you have problems.  I want to make this work.
