## In this folder there are examples of Jupyter Notebook files [.ipynb extension]
### To view each file you have three simple and short options.  
 - The easist is to add a Notebook viewer Add-in to your Browser, then just click on the file
 - You can also download the Anaconda Framework from https://github.com/LeeSmithSBCC/Jupyter-Math-For-Nerds/blob/master/IntroImage.PNG
  -- Just select the Framework for your compute:r Windows/Mac OS/Linix 
  -- Understand that the download is larger than 500 MD, so get a cop of coffee [I hope you have speedy WiFi !]
  -- You will get an .exe type file.  Just double click on it and take the defaults [for most users]
  -- If you do this for Windows 10 for PC, start Jupyter from the command line by pressing the 'PLAG' key and R, type in Jupyter.
   - The easiest way is just to to the Jupyter-Math-for-Nerds Folder and click on the DOWNLAD zip button [Upper Right Hand Side of the Page]
  -- A zipped folder will go to your Downloads folder [for most systems].  Unzip it, go to the HTML folder and open it with your Browser.
