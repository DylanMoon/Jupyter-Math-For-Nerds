# I want you to be able to use this simply and easily.
## You do not need to even have to know Python, Jupyter or Sympy.
- You will see that with just a few lines of code [a couple of includes you use in any new file] with a few simple commands like solve (), simplify(), expand() and factor() -- you can do a lot of MATH [INCLUDING those even/odd questions at the end of each chapter that are not solved !?!.

## Ready?

- To keep it simple and short, there are two folders. One has examples that are just HTML coverted from Python/Jupyter/Sympy
- The other has Jupyter Notebooks you can run on your computer.
 -- For this, either install a Plug-In for your favorite Browser, such as Chrome, IE/Edge, FireFox, etc.
 --- The HTML id not interactive.
 ### OR
 -- Install Anaconda [FREE] on your computer --- https://www.anaconda.com/download/.
 --- You can easily add to or change the each Notebook and run other problems.
 -- This is a 500MB file which will take a while to download, but installation is a Double-Click and a few default choices.
 - I recommend that you create a new Folder [call it Jupiter ...] in your Documents folder, for easy access.
 - Starting Jupyer is sooooooo simply --- just hit the FLAG/PC key [small dialog box comes up] and start to type in Jupyter, ENTER
 - This will bring up the Documents folder in a Browser [default is IE/Edge]
 
 ## Have FUN with MATH !!!
