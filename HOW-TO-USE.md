## How to use these files, keeping it simple and short ... and sweet.

### The best way is to download and install the FREE Anaconda framework:  https://www.anaconda.com/download/
#### Using your browswer the Download page should direct you to operating system for your computer:
#### PC, MacOS, Linux

#### You will get a VERY large, single file ~ 700 MB.  So get a cup of coffee ...
##### The file will go into your Downloads Folder
#### Installation only requires double-clicking on the downloaded file and accept the two defaults.To run Jupyter, open your CMD [Windows] or Terminal [MacOS and Linux] and type in Jupyter or Jupyter Notebook.  This opens a  Browser file which starts at http://localhost:8888/tree, DO NOT PANIC you should see a list of your computer Folders.  I suggest you create a Documents/GitHubProjects folder and create new files!
###  The quick way is just go to the PDF folder on this page and click on any file.  [You can not change any file]
### If you use Chrome/Chromium [update to latest version please] you can install an extension nbviewer.  Then you go to the Jupyter folder and click on any of the files.
